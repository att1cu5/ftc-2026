  /**
   * This OpMode illustrates the basics of AprilTag based localization.
   *
   * For an introduction to AprilTags, see the FTC-DOCS link below:
   * https://ftc-docs.firstinspires.org/en/latest/apriltag/vision_portal/apriltag_intro/apriltag-intro.html
   *
   * In this sample, any visible tag ID will be detected and displayed, but only
   * tags that are included in the default "TagLibrary" will be used to compute the
   * robot's location and orientation. This default TagLibrary contains the current
   * Season's AprilTags and a small set of "test Tags" in the high number range.
   *
   * When an AprilTag in the TagLibrary is detected, the SDK provides
   * location and orientation of the robot, relative to the field origin. This
   * information is provided in the "robotPose" member of the returned "detection".
   *
   * To learn about the Field Coordinate System that is defined for
   * FTC (and used by this OpMode), see the FTC-DOCS link below:
   * https://ftc-docs.firstinspires.org/en/latest/game_specific_resources/field_coordinate_system/field-coordinate-system.html

    // Origin location: Center of the lens
    // Axes orientation: +x right, +y down, +z forward (from camera's perspective)
    // Robot axes (this is typical, but you can define this however you want):
    // Origin location: Center of the robot at field height
    // Axes orientation: +x right, +y forward, +z upward
    // Position:
    // If all values are zero (no translation), that implies the camera is at the center of the
    // robot. Suppose your camera is positioned 5 inches to the left, 7 inches forward, and 12
    // inches above the ground - you would need to set the position to (-5, 7, 12).
    // Orientation:
    // If all values are zero (no rotation), that implies the camera is pointing straight up. In
    // most cases, you'll need to set the pitch to -90 degrees (rotation about the x-axis), meaning
    // the camera is horizontal. Use a yaw of 0 if the camera is pointing forwards, +90 degrees if
    // it's pointing straight left, -90 degrees for straight right, etc. You can also set the roll
